Cinemate supports a lightweight guest mode for quick access. Click **Continue as guest** on the login or signup page to enter without creating an account. The app stores `{ guest: true }` in `localStorage` and `ProtectedRoute` considers this authenticated. Use the Log out action to clear guest data.
